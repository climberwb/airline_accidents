<p>To analyze data from that contain all the airline accidents within the united states
and gain a deeper understanding of where these accidents are taking place and why they are occuring.</p>

in AviationAccidents.ipynb. The original text file has information on the type of plane, location, type/severity of accident, time of accident, etc...
</p>
<p>This analysis focuses on location, frequency, time and severity of the accidents.
First the data was converted from a text file into dataframe. The dataframe was then
used to create a color coded map and a bar graph. 
The color coded map of the united states highlights the frequency of the accidents. The darker states have 
more accidents than the lighter colored states. The dataframe used for the bargraph was filterd to only
contain deadly accidents and serious injuries. The bar graph counts this filtered data per month.
